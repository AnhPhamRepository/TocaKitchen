      "info": "Toca Kitchen 2 comes from the award-winning Swedish studio Toca Boca (the name means “touch mouth” in slightly ungrammatical Spanish). Though designed for children aged 3 to 6, the appeal of this app is broad and it’s quite possible for older children – and, ahem, some fathers – to enjoy Toca Kitchen 2 as well. Toca Boca describes this app as a “digital toy”, and so the emphasis is on free play rather than achieving game objectives. This means that there is no scoring, no winning or losing, and no game levels to work through. \n Instead, players prepare meals for three hungry guests – a young girl in a punk t-shirt, a man with a rather nicely groomed moustache and a fuzzy haired monster wearing a green necktie. As you’d expect in an app designed for iPads and iPhones,the game is controlled completely by touch screen. At the left of the screen you can access a fully stocked pantry containing fruit and vegetables (including one very odd-looking blue fruit that resembles Haley’s Comet), bread, fish, and meat. A vegetarian option is also available for families that way inclined (such as ours). Flick to the bottom of the screen and all your seasonings and condiments pop up. Pick up your virtual knife to slice and dice your ingredients. Flick to the right to open a menu for different cooking methods including pan-frying, deep-frying, roasting and a blender. Finally, plate up your dish and wait to see your guest’s reaction at your latest culinary creation.",

In the Pre-Alpha, the Neighbor also threw bear traps while chasing the player. If the player walks into the trap (or interacts with it, prior to Alpha 2), they will be caught and will need to repeatedly press the space bar to escape. If the Neighbor is trapped, he will grab his leg and attempt to pull it out of the jaws of the trap, succeeding after a few attempts. When a trap is triggered, the sound of its jaws snapping shut will attract the attention of the Neighbor, similar to the cameras.\n If the player breaks a window, the Neighbor may place a bear trap next to the window in order to trap the player the instant they jump through it. The player can also pick up bear traps and use them against the Neighbor, but they can only be picked up if the trap is closed. In the Pre-Alpha, there were sometimes three different-sized bear traps hanging on the wall of the garage that served no purpose, but could still trap the player if they walked into them.",
