When kids open the fridge to survey its savory delights, characters will sometimes express their interest in different foods. Kids can prepare the food with six different tools, including a juicer, chopping board, pot, frying pan, deep fryer, and an oven. Next, does the dish need salt and pepper, hot sauce, soy sauce, salad dressing, lemon, or that catch-call kids' favorite: ketchup? Finally, it's feeding time!",

Just like real people, different characters prefer different foods, prepared in different ways. Kids can experiment with extreme flavors to elicit characters' sneezes, smoky coughs, faints, or the spitting out of food they don't like. Budding chefs might make other choices too -- mixing various ingredients or even feeding characters straight out of the fridge. The palate-pleasing possibilities are endless!",
