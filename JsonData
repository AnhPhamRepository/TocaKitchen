Specifically, Protag saw many cells that were mimicking real-world simulations. At this point, the neighbor appeared, chased and locked Protag in the basementSegment 2 revolves around Protag escaping from the basement and trying to escape from a neighbor's current fortified home. After their escape, the game allows players to see a rather deadly scene before the characters return to their homes.Segment 3 is where the Protag is now an adult. He returned to his old house. By the time Protag wakes up in the house, he finds a house across from the neighbor's name. At this point, players will move to start the game.",

If the Neighbor is trapped, he will grab his leg and attempt to pull it out of the jaws of the trap, succeeding after a few attempts. When a trap is triggered, the sound of its jaws snapping shut will attract the attention of the Neighbor, similar to the cameras.\n If the player breaks a window, the Neighbor may place a bear trap next to the window in order to trap the player the instant they jump through it. The player can also pick up bear traps and use them against the Neighbor, but they can only be picked up if the trap is closed. In the Pre-Alpha, there were sometimes three different-sized bear traps hanging on the wall of the garage that served no purpose, but could still trap the player if they walked into them.",
